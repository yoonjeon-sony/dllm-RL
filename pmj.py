    """
    Progressive Multi‑Jittered (PMJ) ordering over an n×n integer grid, n must be a power of two.

    The algorithm recursively subdivides the full grid into 2×2 blocks. At each level, it ensures
    every sub‑block contains exactly one sample by placing a new integer‑grid point uniformly at
    random in each sub‑block that doesn't already contain a sample from a previous level. The
    resulting sequence is progressive: the first 4^k samples are 1‑per‑cell stratified over a
    (n/2^k)×(n/2^k) tiling of the domain.

    Returns
